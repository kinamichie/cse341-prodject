3. I have changed my site to MVC architecture and an using a Json file to hole my data. I have implemented dynamic routes and paths.
4. So far everything is working that I have received instruction on except changing the folder structure on my homework hub. Each time I tried to follow the direction to do that, my program would crash.
5. The coolest thing I learned this week was how to structure the MVC and work with all the routes.

7. 4
8. I understand the routes and the logic behind everything. I just have had trouble re-routing the homework hub. I have my team assignments in there, but not my prove assignments.

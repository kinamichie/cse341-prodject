3. The pages are there and the username is going into the console and re-directing to the User page.
Files are set up in a "module" status as the prove01-routes is transferring the data needed to the prove01.js which acts like a controller.
The username is showing up in the console after it is entered and on the User page.

4. All parts of the assignment are working.

5. The "coolest" thing I learned while completing this assignment was how I had not forgotten much of it since I had to drop the class spring semester. I had deleted all of my assignments I had done before and started over. 

6. I felt that the directions were much clearer than the last time I took the class. I don't think anything needs to change.

7. I felt that I accomplished a 5 this time. I took the time to do the stretch activity and have it working. I also added some CSS to make it look appealing instead of just black and white. 

8. All three paths that were in the assignment are there and they are all working properly. The username displays in the console and on the User page.
